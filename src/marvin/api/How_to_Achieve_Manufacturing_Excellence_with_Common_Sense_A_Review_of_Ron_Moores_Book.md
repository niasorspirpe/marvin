In this article, we will give you an overview of the main concepts and benefits of Moore's book, and how you can apply them to your own manufacturing organization.
 
## What is Common Sense?
 
According to Moore, common sense is "the ability to see things as they are and do things as they ought to be done". It is not something that is innate or universal, but rather something that can be learned and developed through experience and education. Common sense is also context-dependent, meaning that it varies depending on the situation and the goals.
 
Moore argues that common sense is often lacking in many manufacturing organizations, leading to poor performance and wasted resources. He identifies some of the common barriers to common sense, such as:
 
- Lack of clear vision and direction
- Lack of alignment and accountability
- Lack of communication and collaboration
- Lack of data and analysis
- Lack of learning and improvement
- Lack of innovation and creativity

To overcome these barriers, Moore proposes a framework for making common sense common practice in manufacturing. He calls it the **Manufacturing Excellence Model**.
 
## What is the Manufacturing Excellence Model?
 
The Manufacturing Excellence Model is a holistic approach to achieving manufacturing excellence that integrates four key elements: strategy, leadership, culture, and operations. Moore explains each element in detail and provides examples and case studies from various industries. He also provides tools and techniques for assessing and improving each element.
 
The Manufacturing Excellence Model is based on the following principles:

- Manufacturing excellence is a journey, not a destination. It requires continuous learning and improvement.
- Manufacturing excellence is a team effort. It requires collaboration and empowerment across all levels and functions.
- Manufacturing excellence is customer-focused. It requires understanding and meeting the needs and expectations of internal and external customers.
- Manufacturing excellence is data-driven. It requires measuring and managing performance based on facts and evidence.
- Manufacturing excellence is results-oriented. It requires setting and achieving challenging but realistic goals.

By applying the Manufacturing Excellence Model, Moore claims that manufacturing organizations can achieve significant benefits, such as:

- Increased productivity and profitability
- Reduced costs and waste
- Improved quality and reliability
- Enhanced safety and environmental performance
- Better customer satisfaction and loyalty
- Higher employee engagement and retention
- Greater competitive advantage and market share
